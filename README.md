# CMPG-323-Overview--28331869
Detailed module plan to follow throughout the semester , so that I know what is expected from me for each submission and how long each requirement should take me to complete it.

## Branching Strategies

The branching stategy that I will use for all my projects is GitHub Flow , as it focuses on agile principles and it is a fast and streamlined branching strategy with very short production cycles and frequent releases. Additionally this strategy allows for fast feedback loops, enabling teams to rapidly identify issues and resolve them. Since there is no development branch as one is testing an d automating changes to one branch which allows for quick and contionuos deployment. This strategy is suitable for small teams and ideal when needing to maintain a single production version.

## Use of .gitgnore File

A .gitignore file is a plain text file where each line contains a pattern for files/directories to ignore. It is placed in the root folder of the repository or it can be stored in another file and multiple .gitignore files ar allowed. The patterns in the files are relative to the location of that .gitignore file.

## Credentials And Sensitive Information

 Credentials and sensitive information should never be stored on GitHub as the purpose of GitHub is to host code repositories.Past the consents you set for you, there could be no other technique for security that will guarantee that your secret keys, private credentials, and sensitive information reamin inside a controlled and secured environment.
 
 Storing sensitive credentials for projects will be done as mentioned below :

 1. Iâ€™ll utilize a .JSON file for project 2 and 3 API Development and Standards & Patterns.
    
 2.  In Project4 Testing & RPA, credentials will be stored in UiPath Orchestrator.
    
 3. In Project5 Reporting, there will not be credentials that need to be stored.

The Connected Office Initiative (COI) encapsulates the use of IoT devices within the network,
placed all over the office building, to collect and share the data that these devices gather. The
data can be shared in different ways. One of which is through visualisations built into a report or
dashboard. These reports or dashboards can be shared with different stakeholders, potentially
with different levels of access applied. The COI have been advised that a good way to monitor
the usage of their IoT devices would be through a report.
The report will be built in Power BI, as the organisation already has all applicable licensing
agreements in place with Microsoft, and the report is expected to allow all stakeholders to see the
same information pertaining to the status of IoT device registrations on various platforms. As a
member of the COI development team, you are expected to acquire and practise the necessary
skills to create such a report.

## How to use the report

The user selects a filter on the Filtering page based on Category,Zone, Registration date and Device platform. After selecting the filters, when the user navigates to the Device monitorig, Device registration and High-level Metrics pages the data will be filtered.

Below are images of each page created and what they contain: 

THE FILTERING PAGE contains filters that can be applied across pages and visuals on each page. These filters allows users to filter the reports based on device category, device platform, device zone and device registration date.

THE HIGH-LEVEL METRICS PAGE is a summarized view that shows business stakeholders a high-level
view of the important data namely , the number of sub-categories, number of categories, number of devices, number of zones, number of active devices and count of ID by IsActive.

THE DEVICE MONITORING PAGE contains visuals that allows the user
to monitor count of devices per category, count of devicces per zone and count of device according to status being either online or offline.

THE DEVICE REGISTRATION PAGE contains visuals that allows the user to see how many devices have been registered over a timespan, how many categories of devices have been created as well as how many zones contain registered devices on a timespan.
