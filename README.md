# CMPG-323-Overview--28331869
Detailed module plan to follow throughout the semester , so that I know what is expected from me for each submission and how long each requirement should take me to complete it.

## Branching Strategies

The branching stategy that I will use for all my projects is GitHub Flow , as it focuses on agile principles and it is a fast and streamlined branching strategy with very short production cycles and frequent releases. Additionally this strategy allows for fast feedback loops, enabling teams to rapidly identify issues and resolve them. Since there is no development branch as one is testing an d automating changes to one branch which allows for quick and contionuos deployment. This strategy is suitable for small teams and ideal when needing to maintain a single production version.

## Use of .gitgnore File

A .gitignore file is a plain text file where each line contains a pattern for files/directories to ignore. It is placed in the root folder of the repository or it can be stored in another file and multiple .gitignore files ar allowed. The patterns in the files are relative to the location of that .gitignore file.

## Credentials And Sensitive Information

 Credentials and sensitive information should never be stored on GitHub as the purpose of GitHub is to host code repositories.Past the consents you set for you, there could be no other technique for security that will guarantee that your secret keys, private credentials, and sensitive information reamin inside a controlled and secured environment.
 
 Storing sensitive credentials for projects will be done as mentioned below :

 1. I’ll utilize a .JSON file for project 2 and 3 API Development and Standards & Patterns.
    
 2.  In Project4 Testing & RPA, credentials will be stored in UiPath Orchestrator.
    
 3. In Project5 Reporting, there will not be credentials that need to be stored.

## PROJECT 4 Testing & RPA 

## Overview

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) refers to the use of technology to mimic human tasks in the same way that a person would execute a process. This usually refers to, what we would call,‘front-end’ or UI (User Interface) automation. RPA is often used to automate time-consuming and highly repetitive tasks to allow people the availed capacity to work on more intuitive tasks.


In this project automation was done on the Connected Office Web Application. It automates the different web forms Devices, Zones and Categories on the given web application. It reads items from an excel file for each of these forms, fills them in and then displaying the item details. Items can be edited and delete, onces all these .The excel file in the UiPath project contains a "Test Results" sheet containing the value "FALSE" before you run the project file. This "FALSE" value is changed to "TRUE" to indicate that the item was created successfully.

 
  
  ## How Stakeholders should use the report
  
Stakeholders has to run the automation on UIPath community studio, the automation solution takes input from the excel, then populates the database table and then the tables are updated and deleted automatically .

  1.  LoginS, with username and password
  2.  Select the item you would like to create.
  3. Once the item is created it displayed, it can then be edited or deleted.
  4. If all edit , delete, read and create functions are functional and the process is done successfully the data table is updated and the test result is     changed from FALSE to TRUE

# LOGIN web form
The login button to be clicked and allow for login details are automatically populated.

# Zone web form

The Zone webform reads data from the provided excel file from sheet zone, to the Zone form in the web browser. When reading is done the data will be created automatically using the create button. The all data that has been created can then be viewed and can be edited and deleted.


# Device Web form
The Device webform reads data from the provided excel file from sheet device, to the device form in the web browser. When reading done the data will be created automatically using the create button. The all data that has been created can then be viewed and can be edited and deleted.



# Category  Web form

The Category web form reads data from the provided excel file from sheet category, to the category form in the web browser. When reading done the data will be created automatically using the create button. The all data that has been created can then be viewed and can be edited and deleted.

# Process published on Orchestrator

image

Althought it shows that the processs has been published , it is not visible on my Orchestrator. Ive tried multiple times, eventually it just gives me the error:"Publish of Process failied. Package already exists".

## PROJECT 5 Reporting and Monitoring
# Overview

The Connected Office Initiative (COI) encapsulates the use of IoT devices within the network,
placed all over the office building, to collect and share the data that these devices gather. The
data can be shared in different ways. One of which is through visualisations built into a report or
dashboard. These reports or dashboards can be shared with different stakeholders, potentially
with different levels of access applied. The COI have been advised that a good way to monitor
the usage of their IoT devices would be through a report.
The report will be built in Power BI, as the organisation already has all applicable licensing
agreements in place with Microsoft, and the report is expected to allow all stakeholders to see the
same information pertaining to the status of IoT device registrations on various platforms. As a
member of the COI development team, you are expected to acquire and practise the necessary
skills to create such a report.
 
 


## How to use the report

The user selects a filter on the Filtering page based on Category,Zone, Registration date and Device platform. After selecting the filters, when the user navigates to the Device monitorig, Device registration and High-level Metrics pages the data will be filtered. 

# Filtering 
THE FILTERING PAGE contains filters that can be applied across pages and visuals on each page. These filters allows users to filter the reports based on device category, device platform, device zone and device registration date. The user must click on this page in order to see the view below. Once they have clicked the desired data to filter the can navigate to the other pages where data will be filtered.


file:///home/mecaylla/Downloads/Filtering%20%20Sheet![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110894098/201111108-a80eb603-c1be-4125-9318-7842e617fdee.png)

## High-level Metrics
THE HIGH-LEVEL METRICS PAGE is a summarized view that shows business stakeholders a high-level
view of the important data namely , the number of sub-categories, number of categories, number of devices, number of zones, number of active devices and count of ID by IsActive. In orde for the user to see this report they have to click on "High-level Metrics" page.

# Device Monitoring
THE DEVICE MONITORING PAGE contains visuals that allows the user
to monitor count of devices per category, count of devicces per zone and count of device according to status being either online or offline.  
The user can see the reports on devices.

# Device Registration

THE DEVICE REGISTRATION PAGE contains visuals that allows the user to see how many devices have been registered over a timespan, how many categories of devices have been created as well as how many zones contain registered devices on a timespan. In order for the user to see the report below, the user has to click on "The device registration" page.
